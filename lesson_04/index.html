		<p>Bray (Irish: Bré [bʲɾʲeː]) is a coastal town in north County Wicklow, Ireland. It is situated about <mark>20
				km</mark>
			(12mi) south of Dublin city centre on the east coast. It has a population of <mark>33,512</mark>
			making it the tenth
			largest
			urban
			area
			within Ireland (at the 2022 census). Bray is home to Ardmore Studios, and some light industry is located in
			the
			town,
			with some business and retail parks on its southern periphery. Commuter links between Bray and Dublin are
			provided by
			rail, Dublin Bus and the M11 and M50 motorways. Parts of the town's northern outskirts are in County Dublin.
			The town
			is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.</p>
		<p>Originally developed as a planned resort town in the 19th century, Bray's popularity as a seaside resort was
			serviced by
			the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, which was extended to Bray in <mark>1854</mark>. During the late 20th
			century, the
			town's
			use as a
			resort declined when foreign travel became an option for holiday-makers. However, day-trippers continued to
			come to Bray
			during the summer months.</p>

		<h1 id="etymology" class="main__title">Etymology</h1>
		<p>The name Bray is an anglicisation of the Irish Bré, whose meaning is unclear. Liam Price suggested it may
			be
			an old
			name for the River Dargle or a tributary. In <mark>1875</mark> P. W. Joyce mistakenly ascribed the Irish name
			Brí, an old
			word
			meaning "hill", referring in this case to Bray Head. In a 1905 Gaelic League publication advocating use of
			Irish-language postal addresses, Seosamh Laoide coined the name Brí Cualann "Brí in Cualu", as part of his
			policy that
			"If the name of the town [in Irish] be one word, the [ancient Gaelic] territory should be added to it in the
			genitive
			case". Brí and Brí C[h]ualann remained in use in the mid 20th century despite having been refuted by Liam
			Price
			and Osborn Bergin. Bré was adopted by statute in <mark>1975</mark>.</p>

		<h2 id="history" class="main__title">History</h2>
		<p>During the medieval period of Irish history, Bray was situated on the southern border of the Pale, and the
			coastal
			of Ireland, One of the British Isles" by Abraham Ortelius as "Brey". William Brabazon, 1st Earl of Meath
			purchased
			the Killruddery Estate in Bray in <mark>1627</mark> with the establishment of the Earl title.</p>
		<p>The Dublin and Kingstown Railway, the first in Ireland, opened in 1834 and was extended as far as Bray in
			1854.
			With the
			coming of the railway in the mid-19th century, the town grew to become a seaside resort.[8] It was developed
			primarily
			by local entrepreneurs as a planned resort town, modelled on the seaside resorts of the English south-coast,
			specifically Brighton.[8] Hotels and residential terraces were built in the vicinity of the seafront.
			Railway
			entrepreneur William Dargan developed the Turkish baths, designed in a Moorish style at a cost of
			<mark>£10,000</mark>;
			built in
			<mark>1859</mark>, these were demolished in <mark>1980</mark>.
		</p>
		<p>Bray was a popular destination from the 1860s onwards. While small amenities such as regattas, firework
			displays and
			band performances were plentiful in the town, Bray failed to secure the necessary capital to develop major
			attractions
			and sustain tourism, leading to its decline in the early 1900s. Pleasure piers such as the Palace Pier were
			a
			mainstay
			of resorts at that time. Despite repeated efforts, Bray never acquired such a pier and abandoned plans to
			build
			one in
			1906. Additional planned amenities which were never built included a concert hall, a theatre, an exhibition
			centre, a
			marine aquarium, winter gardens and an electrified tramway along the seafront.It experienced a brief
			revival from
			British tourists in the years immediately after World War II. However, Bray's popularity as a seaside resort
			declined
			significantly when foreign travel became an option for holiday-makers. Its proximity to Dublin still makes
			it a
			popular
			destination for day-trippers from the capital.</p>

		<h2 id="location" class="main__title">Location</h2>
		<p>The town is situated on the east coast to the south of County Dublin. Shankill, County Dublin lies to the
			north, and
			Greystones, County Wicklow to the south. The village of Enniskerry lies to the west of the town, at the foot
			of
			the
			Wicklow Mountains. People participate in such sports as sailing, rowing, and swimming. The beach and
			seafront
			promenade
			are used by residents and visitors. While Bray's promenade and south beach is to a Blue Flag standard, the
			north
			beach has been impacted by erosion and leaching pollution since the closure and sale of a municipal landfill
			in
			the late
			20th century.</p>
		<p>The River Dargle which enters the sea at the north end of Bray rises from a source near Djouce, in the
			Wicklow
			Mountains. Bray Head is situated at the southern end of the Victorian Promenade with paths leading to the
			summit and
			along the sea cliffs. The rocks of Bray Head are a mixture of greywackes and quartzite. There is a large
			cross
			at the
			summit.</p>

		<h2 id="climate" class="main__title">Climate</h2>
		<p>Bray has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), similar to most other towns in Ireland, with few
			extremes
			of
			temperature and abundant precipitation year round. However, Bray is relatively sheltered from the prevailing
			south-westerly winds by the Wicklow Mountains and receives around 750 mm (30 in) of rainfall per year. The
			sunniest
			months on average are May and June, while October is by far the wettest.</p>
